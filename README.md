# tableau-SDK


### Introduction 
Many businesses use tableau as their data visualization and reporting software tool, and producing such files from a python data frame and publishing to the server can greatly help automate the process.

### Purpose
The following to files contain the functions and basic structure needed to build a hyper extract file from a pandas dataframe for most data types, and then publish this hyper extract file to a specified server.

tableau_extract.py  = generates the hyper extract files 
tableau_publish.py = publishes the files to a specific server

### Conclusion
Now that Salesforce has purchased Tableau, it will be interesting to see what self service tools they build in this space to further automate the process for end users.  Until that process is streamlined though, this is one of the easiest ways to get started.
